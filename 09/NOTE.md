# Note

The test cases have been left out, by renaming to `dt1.txt` and `dt2.txt`.
This is because the window size is different from the actual input, and
currently `aoc` doesn't support running with different parameters for the
program, when the parameter is not part of the input.

## Re-enabling Commented Tests:

To re-enable the tests, the `window_size` must be set to `5` in the program
code.
